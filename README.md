# FIFA19-Predictive-Machine-Learning
The goal of this report is: * predicting a transformation of the player `Position` variable,  * predicting player's market `Value`   using the `fifa_exam.RDS` dataset by using predictive machine learning modeling in R with "tidymodels" package.
It can be seen that in the raw data set we don't have the `Overall` variable, so it makes it more complicated to only implement random models. As always, we prepare the data set as much as possible in order to get the best models based on our goals.
